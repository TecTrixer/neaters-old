# NEAT

This is an implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithm NEAT (Neuro Evolution through Augmenting Topologies). It will be benchmarked by learning to play Tic Tac Toe against itself. If you want to learn more about this machine learning algorithm here is the [link](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf "Original Paper") to the original paper from 2002.
